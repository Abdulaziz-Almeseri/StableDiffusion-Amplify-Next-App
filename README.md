## Getting Started

This application was created from the [Program With Erik](http://erik.video) YouTube Channel! The [video](https://youtu.be/B6XefXLyRcA) walks you through creating this app.

### Setup

Make sure to update the `generate.ts` with your key from [replicate](replicate.io) to use this!

Also you'll need to create an account with AWS for [free](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

To use this exact template with your Amplify back end you can clone this repository then run `amplify init`. See [Migrate Project](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/migration/cli-migrate-aws-account/)
